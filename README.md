# Sliding Window – DSA Problems in C#

This repository contains solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems focused on the **Sliding Window** technique, implemented in C#.

## Each solution includes:
1. Problem statement  
2. Clean and well-commented code  
3. Time and space complexity analysis  

## Purpose of this repository:
1. Practice and strengthen problem-solving skills using the Sliding Window technique  
2. Build a strong foundation in core DSA concepts using C#  
3. Share code that is easy to understand, read, and maintain  
4. These problems are already covered under their respective DSA topics, but this repository is specially categorized to separate and focus on **Sliding Window problems** only.  

## How to run:
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in any C# IDE or editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code with C# extension)  
3. Build and run the program
